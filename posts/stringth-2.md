In this note we'll discuss the quantization of bosonic strings in light cone gauge, and give a proof of the no-ghost theorem. Ghost elimination is awkward in the covariant quantization, this is the price it pays to maintain Lorentz invariance. Instead, we can gauge away some degrees of freedom by explicitly solving the constraint equations, this would give a ghost free physical space, but the manifest Lorentz invariance hides away. Requiring the Lorentz invariance would result in the no-ghost theorem mentioned in the previous note.
