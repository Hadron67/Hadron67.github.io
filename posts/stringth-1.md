In this note we'll discuss classical bosonic strings, and briefly introduce the quantization procedure.

This note follows *Superstring Theory* by Edward Witten, and *Introduction to String Theory and M-Theory* by Michio Kaku.

Action of a string can be an analogy of that of a relativistic point particle, whose action is given by the worldline length:
$$ S = -m\int \sqrt{-\dot x^2}\dd\tau. $$
